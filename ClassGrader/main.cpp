/* This program calculates student grades based on the assignments and weights
* provided in a syllabus file, and stores the result in a new file for each student.
* Programmer: Sadad Yusuf
* Date: 8/21/2024
 
 * Pseudocode:
  Declare variables:

    Create strings to hold the file name, student name, and assignment titles.
    Create integer variables to store weights, number of students, and assignment grades.
    Create double variables to store the total grade.
    Ask for syllabus file name:

 Prompt the user for the syllabus file name.
    Validate if the file exists. If it doesn't, keep asking until a valid file name is provided.
    Read syllabus data:

 Use a loop to read each assignment's title and its weight from the file.
    Store the data in corresponding vectors (title in assignments and weight in weights).
    Ask for the number of students:

 Prompt the user to enter the number of students.
    Validate the input to ensure it's a valid number (no decimals, negative numbers, etc.).
    Process student files:

 For each student, open their respective file (based on student number).
    Read the student's name and their grades from the file.
    Calculate their total grade by applying the assignment weights to their grades.
    Write the student's grade and other information to a new file.
 
 End the program:
 After processing all student files, close any open file streams and terminate the program.
